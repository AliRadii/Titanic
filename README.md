# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. It is a **hands-on implementation of data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling** using Python and popular libraries.

The goal is to **understand patterns in the Titanic dataset** and build predictive models to classify whether a passenger survived.

## Dataset

The dataset is the famous Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
It contains information such as passenger age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived.

---

## Features

* Passenger class (`Pclass`)  
* Sex (`Sex`)  
* Age (`Age`)  
* Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)  
* Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)  
* Ticket (`Ticket`)  
* Fare (`Fare`)  
* Cabin (`Cabin`)  
* Port of Embarkation (`Embarked`)

## Algorithms & Models

* **Logistic Regression** — Binary classification of survival.  
* **Random Forest** — Ensemble learning for higher accuracy.  
* **Decision Tree** — Tree-based classifier.  
* **Gradient Boosting** (optional) — Boosted tree ensemble for improved performance.  

### Preprocessing Steps
* Handling missing values  
* Encoding categorical variables  
* Feature scaling  
* Train/test split

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3  
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
* **Framework:** Jupyter Notebook
